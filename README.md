## 🧪 TCGA Dataset Analysis - Exercises

We are providing you with a **TCGA dataset** along with a set of exercises to enhance your bioinformatics and data analysis skills. These tasks involve both **theoretical** understanding and **practical** implementation.  

📌 **Instructions**:
- Perform the analysis as outlined below.
- Compile your results into a **PowerPoint presentation**.
- Attach all **pipelines**, **scripts**, and **code** used in the analysis.
- Use appropriate **visualizations** wherever applicable.

---

### 🔹 Exercise 1: Dataset Overview

- Load the TCGA dataset and provide a summary including:
  - The **number of samples per cancer type**
  - The **mean and standard deviation** of expression levels for each gene
  - The **top 5 most variable genes** across all samples

---

### 🔹 Exercise 2: Differential Expression Analysis

- Identify the **top 10 differentially expressed genes** between 5 cancer types using a **t-test** or **Wilcoxon rank-sum test**
- Visualize gene expression using:
  - **Heatmap**
  - Additional plots (boxplots, violin plots, etc.) are encouraged

---

### 🔹 Exercise 3: Clustering Analysis

- Perform **Hierarchical Clustering** or **K-means Clustering** on the dataset using all genes
  - Visualize clustering using:
    - **Dendrogram**
    - **t-SNE** or **PCA plot**
  - Interpret whether cancers with similar **tissue origins** cluster together

---

### 🔹 Exercise 4: Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

- Perform **PCA** and plot the **first two principal components**, color-coded by cancer type
  - Report the **variance explained** by PC1 and PC2
  - Interpret whether certain cancer types **separate clearly** in PCA space

---

### 🔹 Exercise 5: Machine Learning for Cancer Type Prediction

- Build a classification model using:
  - **Random Forest** or **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
  - Split the dataset: **80% training**, **20% testing**
  - Evaluate performance with:
    - **Accuracy**
    - **Precision**
    - **Recall**
    - **F1-score**

---

### 🔹 Exercise 6: Feature Selection / Biomarker Discovery

- Use **Logistic Regression** or **Random Forest feature importance** to identify genes that best distinguish **one specific cancer type** from all others
  - Report genes with **highest predictive value**
  - Compare findings with known **biomarkers in literature**

---

### 🔹 Exercise 7: Gene-Gene Co-expression Network

- Identify co-expression networks using **Pearson or Spearman correlation**
  - Select the **top 100 most variable genes**
  - Compute a **correlation matrix** and visualize it using a **heatmap**
  - Identify **clusters of co-expressed genes**

---

### 🌟 Bonus Question: Multi-Omics Integration (Theoretical)

- Suppose you have access to **mutation**, **methylation**, and **copy number variation** data.  
  👉 How would you integrate these with gene expression to better classify cancer types?

**Task**: Design a **workflow** to integrate multi-omics data for cancer classification.

---

📌 **Note**: Any *creative or out-of-the-box analysis and visualizations* beyond the tasks listed will be considered a **bonus**!
